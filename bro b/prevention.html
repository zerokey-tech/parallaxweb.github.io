                <p> <b>Mobile phone scams</b><br>
Smartphones are mini-computers, so take all the same precautions with them as you would with your own computer at home.<br>Downloading them from unofficial or unknown sources could infect your phone with a virus.

Keep your phone’s operating system updated with the latest security patches and upgrades. Your operating system provider normally sends these.

Never give your mobile banking security details, including your passcode, to anyone else and don’t store them on your phone.

For added security set up a password or PIN to lock your mobile.

Just like on your computer, you can get antivirus tools for your mobile; use a reputable brand. Some banks offer free antivirus software for their customers’ phones. Check your bank’s website for more information.

                    Be wary of clicking on links in a text message or email. Don’t respond to unsolicited messages or voicemails on your phone. Your bank will never email or text to ask for your PIN or full password.</p>
                <br><br><p><b>Examples of mobile phone scams</b><br>
Text scams offering you money for an accident you may have had is often a ploy to get your personal details. Don’t reply, even by sending a ‘STOP’ text. Simply delete the message.

You may get a text or advert encouraging you to enter a competition for a great prize. The scammers will charge extremely high rates for the messages you send them, as high as £2 per text message. Don’t reply.<br>

‘Trivia scams’ involve you answering general knowledge questions to win a prize. The first few questions will be very easy, so you keep playing. But the last one or two questions you need to answer to claim your ‘prize’ could be very difficult or even impossible.<br>

If you try to claim your prize, you may have to call a premium-rate number, often beginning 0906. You then have to listen to a long recorded message, designed to keep you on the line. It’s highly unlikely there’ll be a prize at the end of it. Don’t phone back to claim.

‘SMiShing’ (SMS phishing) is when a scammer texts asking for personal or financial information. The message may appear to be from a legitimate company, like a mobile phone provider, but legitimate companies never ask you to provide sensitive information by text. Don’t reply to these texts. Simply delete them.<br>

Unless you’re using a secure webpage, don’t send or receive private information when using public WiFi. And be aware of who’s around you when using a mobile device to go online.

                <P><b>Internet scams</b><Br>
Many internet scams take place without the victim even noticing. Scammers put programs on your computer that can steal, wipe or lock your data. To prevent this, have antivirus software and a firewall installed on your computer, and keep it up to date.

Take the precautions below and use common sense to avoid becoming a victim.<br>
                    Scammers defraud people using spam emails. Simply delete the email without opening or replying to it, otherwise the scammer will send you more and more emails from lots of different addresses.

Any email you get from someone you don’t know is likely to be spam, especially if it’s not addressed to you personally and promises you some kind of gain.<br>

If you get an email with an attachment, apparently from someone you know, but it’s not the usual sort of message you get from them, don’t open the attachment. Contact the person who’s supposed to have sent it and confirm it’s genuine. The email may have been infected with a virus and forwarded through their address book.

Online marketplaces can be a lot of fun and can save you money but they’re also used by scammers. Scammers will try to steer you away from online sites and get you to use unusual payment methods, such as money transfer agents or e-money, a digital equivalent of cash.<br><br>Adverts and websites can be very sophisticated so do some research to make sure everything makes sense. Always think about your personal safety when meeting anyone you’ve only talked to on the internet.

Be careful of official-looking but bogus websites that claim to help you apply for passports, visas and driving licences.<br><br>

                    <i>There are lots of ways scammers gain personal or financial information from their victims, such as:</i><br><br>
<ul >
    <li>phishing, where an email that seems to be from a legitimate company asks you to give your personal details</li>
<li>vishing, where either an automated phone message or a cold-caller who seems to be from a legitimate company asks you for personal details</li>
<li>spear phishing, which focuses on an individual or department in an organisation; the email appears to come from a legitimate organisation</li>
                    </ul>
